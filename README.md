# My-Data-Analysis-Bootcamp
I decided to take data analytics seriously again. Here I will be sharing every exercise, as a means to hold myself accountable and in case anyone wishes to take a peek.

I will be sharing every project subsequently, from the most basic to NASA standard projects.
This should be fun.
